## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Vehicle length and ground clearance are statistcally unlikely to provide random amount of variance to the linear model. This means smaller cars that are lower to the ground are likely to increase fuel efficiency. The slope of the linear model is not zero with a p-value of 5.35 x 10-11. According to Pearson's correlation, the linear model predicts mpg strongly with an r-squared of 0.7149 (0.72 rounded). The use of a multiple linear regression showed variables that are more likely to be statistically significant in predicting mpg such as vehicle length and ground clearance. Variables that showed to be not significant in predicting mpg were weight, angle, and AWD.


## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

- The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

Results of the individual lot summary show lots 1 and 2 met specification goals of suspension coil variance not exceeding 100 pounds per square inch, while lot 3 does not with a variance of 220. 

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

- Briefly summarize your interpretation and findings for the t-test results. Include screenshots of the t-test to support your summary.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

- Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. 

- What metric or metrics are you going to test?
- What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
- What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
- What data is needed to run the statistical test?
